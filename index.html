        <h2>Blackjack Rules: <br><br>
            If player or dealer obtains blackjack on first turn then it is their win unless both obtain blackjack which will be neutral (no chips are taken or given). <br><br>
            Player can choose to hit or stand: <br> <br>
            Hit means to be dealt a card, if hit 21 sum then you instant win, otherwise over 21 means you bust and lost
            Stand means to have the dealer proceed, in which if his sum is 16 under, he must hit. If 17 over then he stands and then values between the two hands are compared <br><br> Whoever has higher hand at this point wins the game, if tied then house wins. <br><br>
            These are not the only or full rules, this is meant to be a simulation or test project.</h2>
